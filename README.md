### Paper 01 - SMAP

Méndez-Romero, D. and Fernández-Getino García, M. J. (2018). Simpler Multipath Detection for Vehicular OFDM Channel Tracking. IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,
67(11):10752-10759. DOI: 10.1109/TVT.2018.2868445

Results: A computationally inexpensive, threshold-based abrupt-change detector called Simplified Maximum A Posteriori (SMAP) is presented. Simulations show this estimator greatly reduces channel tracking error in the target SNR range at a very small computational cost, thus outperforming previously known systems.
